# Game Theory Solver
Game theory is a series of tools and methods which attempt to model rational behavior given agents with payoffs. Here, rational behavoir is defined as having complete and transitive preferences. In other words, each agent is able to compare the value for all of her options and rank order them. The rank ordering of the preferences satisfy transitivitiy.

Currently, this repo can find any Nash Equilibrium in two player simultaneous game with n*m choices and deterministic strategies.

Next step is to allow for stochastic strategies and non-memory, iterative games (like axelrod's tournament). Similarly, explore visualizations for steady states in such games. This was inspired by [Nicky Case's](http://ncase.me/trust/) video on the subject.
